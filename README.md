## Introduction
Dayflow is a Human Resource Management System (HRMS) designed to digitize
and streamline core HR operations such as employee management, attendance
tracking, and leave management.

This project is developed as part of the Odoo x GCET Hackathon 2026 and
focuses on building a practical and scalable solution within the hackathon
time constraints.

## Problem Statement
Many organizations rely on manual processes or disconnected tools to manage
HR activities such as employee records, attendance, and leave tracking.
These approaches lead to inefficiencies, data inconsistency, and increased
administrative workload.

There is a need for a centralized and user-friendly HRMS to efficiently
manage these HR processes.

## Proposed Solution
Dayflow provides a centralized digital platform where:
- Admin/HR users can manage employee records and attendance
- Employees can view their details and apply for leave

The system is developed as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that demonstrates
the core functionality of an HRMS and is designed to be extended with
advanced features in the future.

## Features Implemented
- Authentication with role-based authorization (Admin / Employee)
- Dashboard for easy navigation
- Employee management module (Admin access)
- Attendance management
- Leave application module
- Persistent data storage using browser LocalStorage
- Clean and responsive user interface

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Storage: Browser LocalStorage
- Version Control: Git & GitHub

## Alignment with Requirements
This project is developed as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) based on the
Dayflow HRMS requirement document.

Core modules such as authentication and role-based authorization,
employee management, attendance tracking, and leave management are
implemented as part of the MVP.

Advanced features including payroll management, approval workflows,
analytics, and reports are planned as future enhancements.

## Future Scope
- Secure backend authentication and authorization
- Leave approval workflow for Admin/HR
- Payroll and salary management
- Analytics and reporting dashboard
- Mobile application support

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `login.html` in a web browser
3. Login as Admin or Employee to access system features

## Acknowledgements
We would like to thank Odoo, GCET, and our mentor for their guidance and
support throughout the hackathon.
