# ODDO Hackathon – HRMS Web Application (MVP)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **front-end based HRMS (Human Resource Management System) MVP** developed for the **ODDO Hackathon – Virtual Round**. The aim of this project is to demonstrate a **clean user interface, role-based access, and core HRMS workflows** as described in the official problem statement.

The application focuses on **Admin and Employee roles**, showcasing how an organization can manage employees and HR-related activities in a simple, intuitive, and scalable way.

> ⚠️ This project is an **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** created specifically for the **virtual screening round**, focusing on clarity of concept, usability, and presentation rather than full backend implementation.
